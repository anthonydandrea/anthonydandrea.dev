summary: "A programmable metronome and practice tool for music ensembles."

I've done a lot of marching band. I started in high school and performed for about 8 years, from high school to competing in World Class Drum Corps, aka the most competitive marching bands in the world.

The standard metronome tool these days has been the [DB-90](https://www.boss.info/us/products/db-90/). It is very consistent, and provides a good sound.

That being said, it has some massive drawbacks:
1. The UI makes it difficult to do anything other than play one tempo 
   - Programming it is a massive undertaking
   - Generally, there were only a couple people who knew how to work it
1. All the memory is stored on the device, so students cannot easily practice at home with the same programmed metronome sequences the band might use
   - The device is expensive (> $100) so infeasible to ask everyone to buy and program their own
   - This makes practicing passages with tempo changes and multiple time signatures nearly impossible
1. All the programming is **lost if the battery dies**
   - :(

There is one other app which (at the time of writing this) the community would probably consider a viable alternative to the DB-90, known as [TonalEnergy](https://www.tonalenergy.com/). This app does *a lot* of stuff well, and is sufficiently programmable. However, it still is challenging to share programs with ensembles as everything is locally stored, and the UI is still difficult to get the hang of; most people I know don't ever program or run programs on it.

Since I was pursuing my degree in Computer Science and had a deep understanding of the problems with the present state-of-the-art, I wanted to see if I could make something better.

Behold, [MetPro34.com](https://metpro34.com/) was born!
